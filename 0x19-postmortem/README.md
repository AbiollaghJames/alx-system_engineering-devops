4-08-2023: 00:10 - The operations team was alerted to the downtime through monitoring systems.
4-08-2023: 00:13 - The operations team initiated troubleshooting and diagnosis of the issue.
4-08-2023: 00:24 - After thorough investigation, the root cause was identified.
4-08-2023: 00:30 - Mitigation steps were implemented to restore the web server.
4-08-2023: 00:40 - The web server was successfully brought back online, and services were fully restored.

**Root Causes:**

High network traffic due to an unexpected surge in user requests contributed to network congestion. This overwhelmed the server's capacity and slowed down response times.

The increased load on the server caused the exhaustion of critical resources such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O. This led to a cascading failure where the server's performance deteriorated rapidly.


**Mitigation Steps:**

To distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers, we deployed a load balancer. This helped prevent a single server from becoming overloaded and improved overall system stability.

We upgraded our server infrastructure by adding more resources, including CPU, memory, and storage. This enhanced the server's capacity to handle spikes in traffic without resource exhaustion.

Caching: Implementation of caching mechanisms reduced the need to generate dynamic content for each user request. This significantly improved response times and reduced strain on the server.


**Preventive Measures:**

Implement an automated scaling system that can dynamically allocate resources based on traffic patterns. This helps to prevent resource exhaustion during sudden traffic spikes.

Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect unusual traffic patterns, high resource utilization, and potential bottlenecks. This allows for quicker response times in addressing potential issues.

Conduct regular load testing to identify the server's limits and optimize resource allocation. This helps in understanding how the server performs under different traffic scenarios.
